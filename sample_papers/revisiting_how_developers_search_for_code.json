  "abstract": "Code search is an integral part of a developerâ€™s workflow. In 2015, researchers published a paper reflecting on the code search practices of 27 developers. That paper had first-hand accounts for why those developers were using code search, and highlighted how often and in what situations developers were searching for code. In the past decade, much has changed in the landscape of developer support. New languages have emerged, AI for code generation has gained traction, auto-complete in the IDE has gotten better, Q&A forums have increased in popularity, and code repositories are larger than ever. It is worth considering whether those observations from almost a decade ago have stood the test of time.",
